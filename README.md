# 100DaysOfSwift

ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This project is meant to follow along with Paul Hudsonâ€™s 100 Days of Swift challenge. There are many 100 Days of Swift challenges out there in the wild, but Paul is one of the best contributors to education that the Swift community has, and when I saw him throw down the gauntlet, I couldnâ€™t resist taking part.

As the first day of this endeavor, a brief introduction is in order. Iâ€™ve been learning Swift and iOS development for a few months I am an developer who has decided to take the leap into native â€” thus, diving into the wonderful world of Swift, iOS, macOS, server-side Swift, and beyond.

Swift has been love at first line of code. While this is a topic that deserves a much larger write-up, I will say that Swift, in many ways, feels like a culmination for me â€” the kind of language Iâ€™ve wanted to write in for quite some time. With that in mind, Iâ€™m actually planning on Infinity days of Swift. But thatâ€™s neither here nor there: The people want 100, so I'll do my best to provide something valuable within those parameters.

Each "day" folder will contain a write-up where I'll recap the material covered, while also trying to interject my own insight, opinions, and reflections on how I'm learning and growing. Furthermore, when possible, Iâ€™ll try to include any code that was written along the way, links to relevant articles and information that I find online -- basically, whatever I can think of that's useful and relevant.

Projects

Here will be some projects that  I created alongside.
